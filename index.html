  <h2><a href="https://mikegroat.github.io/p5JS_fun/recursive_trees/">Recursive Trees!</a></h2>
<p>This was my first attempt at creating a recursive tree.  You can regenerate the tree by pressing any key once on the webpage.</p>
<p></p>
  <h2><a href="https://mikegroat.github.io/p5JS_fun//recursive_trees_2/">Recursive Trees 2!</a></h2>
<p>As suggested by the title, this was my second attempt at generaging recursive trees.  This one improves on the first attempt as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> It builds the tree first, then gives you ways to change the way the tree is displayed via a set of sliders.</li>
<li> You can regenerate a new tree by depressing any key on the keyboard whilst in the webpage.</li>
</ol>
